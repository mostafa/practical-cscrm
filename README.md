# Practical Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management

This repository contains slides, files, and other pieces of data I used to present a talk, called "Practical Supply Chain Risk Management", at the [Practical Cloud Security](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Stockholm/events/286092894/) physical event organized on the June 2nd, 2022 by [GDG Cloud Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Stockholm/) and [Women in Security Sweden](https://www.meetup.com/women-in-security-stockholm-sweden/) groups in Stockholm, Sweden at [Tink AB](https://tink.com/).

 I wrote a summary of my presentation on [my blog](https://mostafa.dev/practical-cybersecurity-supply-chain-risk-management-7a54ed7d9cc7).
